# Selling Drupal
> A notebook about "selling" Drupal to potential clients, companies, organizations etc. Or, alternatively, a list of Drupal advantages against other solutions.

## What to consider
- Sell Drupal as a "Story", as a narative.
- Sell Drupal as an approach, as a philosophy.
- Drupal has the flexibility to adapt on custom needs (eg a business logic).
- Try to talk about the customer Roadmap and plans and why Drupal can support these.
- Demonstrate the success of others on the same industry due to Drupal (similar showcases).
- Sell what Drupal can do and no other tool can do easily (eg full structured Content management).
- Sell the long term strategy.
- Drupal minimazes client risks (Drupal is not a risky solution).
- Emphasize to the (open source) license only when there is a migration from a commercial product to Drupal.
- Promote the integration with 3rd party tools (so customers don't feel to be restricted by Drupal).
- Drupal (usually) costs more initially but has lower cost long term.
- Instead of paying for a commercial license pay to extend or make better your solution.
- Try to learn what is the current opinion the customer has about Drupal.
- Try to learn how is the customer now solving problems (what system is using, who manages it, what are the issues, what is the cost etc).  

## What to avoid
- Don's sell what it does or how it works.
- Don't try to present Drupal as a box of lego pieces (do it yourself toy) but as a complete toy (a ready to play car of legos).
- Don't be too generic about Drupal features.
- Don't compare to others except if there is already a system to replace.
- Don't sell Drupal as a product.
- Avoid demos of any type.
- Avoid showing large tables of Drupal capabilities.
- Don't talk about open source vs closed source advantages.
- Don't say that Drupal is a cheap solution or cheaper than other solutions.
- Don't talk about the community, free modules, issues and other Drupal* things.
- Don't use Drupal specific terminology. Speak with end-user functionality terms.
